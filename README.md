# healthful

*healthful* provides HTTP health check endpoints and/or StatsD health check
pings for services. This is geared towards micro-services which don't already
expost HTTP endpoints that could be health checked or don't otherwise generate
stats traffic that might be monitored for health.

## Installation

```
yarn install healthful
```
